# TicTacToe

Our app aims to provide users with a pleasant and calm experience playing the simple board game of Tic Tac toe. There is a simple interface allowing for the user to play and attempt to beat the computer

## Upcoming Features

- 2 Player gameplay
- Varying difficulty from computer gameplay

### Tech

Our Tic Tac Toe program utilizes a very simple collective of technologies to run:

- [Java] - Primary build language!
- [Visual Studio Code] - Robust and simple text editor
- [Dillinger] - Web based markdown editor

And of course our game itself is open source with a soon to be public repository

### Installation

Tic Tac Toe requires [Java RE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) v7+ to run.

Make sure the Java RE is installed and then the game should be able to run from its own packaging.

If the game doesn't open from the package, open its directory in the terminal and enter "java TttGame".

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

The public repository will be available on GitHub soon so that the game can be updated to reflect anything the community might want

### Development Team

Andrew Littleton, Tyler Nguyen, Tommy Nguyen, Nathan Bullock
