Digital Primates Code Test:

You have been provided a series of coding challenges each within their own file with the /problems directory.
To the best of your abilities, we'd like you to solve them within those files.  
We are using the Jest Testing library.  We have provided test files for each problem, and you may use them 
to validate each of your solutions or shortfalls of your approach.

If unit testing with Jest is unfamiliar there are several only documentation sources that should
provide you with a good starting point for test writing.

Please provide documentation regarding your implementation, along with testing to validate the requirements.
You will not be penalized for not being exhaustive but you should be able to explain why to took an approach.
As many additional details that you can provide regarding optimizations/improvements as well as assumptions are helpful.
Please rename or reorganize any of the files in the project to match your finished product.

When you are complete, please use the Share button and grab the `Embed Url` email this to hr@digitalprimates.net
with the subject "YOUR_NAMEDigitalPrimatesCodeTest".
